# RaspiPgmLog
# H1 RaspiPgmLog

# H2 a Raspberrypi to ICSP Microchip microcontrollers through ICSP and JTAG (and SNAP).
Additionally an Arduino can be connected to the Raspberrypi for datalogging. 
RaspiPgmLog uses a web based userinterface which allows to use any kind of browser to upload a HEX file to program the device and to visualize the logged data. 
  
Due to the Raspberry's WIFI interface this solution allows a simple way of isolation between the PC and the target application. 
PICBERRY, openOCD and pymcuprog are used.
