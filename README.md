# RaspiPgmLog

## a Raspberrypi to in circuit serial program (ICSP) Microchip microcontrollers through the ICSP and JTAG Interface. (SNAP may be supported in the future)
Additionally an Arduino can be connected to the Raspberrypi for datalogging. 
RaspiPgmLog uses a web based userinterface which allows to use any kind of browser to upload a HEX file to program the device and to visualize the logged data. 
  
Due to the Raspberry's WIFI interface this solution allows a simple way of isolation between the PC and the target application. 
PICBERRY, openOCD and pymcuprog are used.
